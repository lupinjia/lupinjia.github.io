A [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) based framework for training legged robots in [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/tree/main).

It is totally based on [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym), so it's easy to use for those who are familiar with legged_gym.

Thanks to the performance of [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/tree/main), we can achieve a faster simulation speed than in [IsaacGym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym).
